# Introduction


<abbr title="Red blood cells are one example of cells that do not have DNA">Almost all cells</abbr> of any living organism contain DNA[^1] because DNA is involved in many essential biological processes including building cells and controlling their number and type, the production of energy, the regulation of metabolism, and fighting disease. The term **genome** generally refers to the entire DNA sequence (sequence of nucleotides) of an organism.

The genome includes **genes** - sequences of nucleotides with specific functions that are involved in the production of the proteins needed to carry out many biological roles. It also includes regions of DNA that promote or inhibit gene activity, and regions that do not appear to affect protein production or function.

**Genome editing** is the deliberate alteration of a selected DNA sequence in a living cell by making use of certain proteins. [^2]
