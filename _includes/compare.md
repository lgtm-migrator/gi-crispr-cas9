# Comparison of gene editing methods

The picture below shows the similarities and differences in the structures of ZFN (a), TALEN (b) and CRISPR (c). From a high level point of view:
 - ZFN has Zinc-Fingers and each of them recognize a group of nucleotides (three). The part that does the cutting is the Fok1 enzyme.
 - TALEN has TALE repeats (complex structures) and each recognizes a single nucleotide. The part that does the cutting is the Fok1 enzyme.
 - CRISPR-Cas9 has a guide RNA, which is composed of the <abbr>same nucleotides</abbr> as DNA, and each nucleotide recognizes one DNA nucleotide. The part that does the cutting is the Cas9 protein.

The table below compares the three most widely used gene editing methods: CRISPR-Cas9, ZFN and TALEN. As it can be seen:
 - CRISPR-Cas9 is simpler and cheaper to make (ex. the cost of CRISPR is around $200[^11], whereas the cost of ZFN starts from $3000 and TALEN costs from $400 to $5000[^12])
 - TALENs and ZFNs need more time to be created than CRISPR.
