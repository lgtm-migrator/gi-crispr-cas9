# Other gene editing methods

Before the discovery of the CRISPR gene editing method, two major methods existed: the **Zinc-Finger Nucleases (ZFN)** and the **Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases (TALEN)** method, whose brief overview can be found below.

## Zinc-Finger Nucleases

The picture below illustrates the ZFN method, developed in 2005. The target site of the ZFN is recognized by the *left* and *right* monomers consisting of a tandem array of three to six engineered zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) (three are shown here). Single engineered ZFP can recognize a nucleotide triplet (shown in different colors). Each ZNF is linked to a nuclease domain from the FokI restriction enzyme. Recognition of the target sequence by the left and right ZFPs results in dimerization of the FokI nuclease. DNA cleavage takes place along the spacer sequence (usually 6 bp long, shown in red) between the two ZFP recognition sites.[^6]

## Transcription Activator-Like Effector Nucleases

TALEN is a more recent method, developed in 2011, and its structure is shown in the picture below. TALE repeats are shown as colored ellipses with a final carboxy-terminal truncated “half” repeat. The non-specific nuclease domain from the FokI endonuclease is shown as larger blue and purple objects.  Cleavage by the FokI domains occurs in the “spacer” sequence that lies between the two regions of the DNA bound by the two TALEN monomers.

TODO add some simple description of the TALEN method, with a picture. 

TODO Possibly add video, or find at leat one video that could be added in the media library.
