While researching this topic, I came across a lot of good materials that could be usefull to anyone who whishes to learn more about CRISPR and gene editing. I've selected the ones that I believe would help the reader the most, without cluttering the contents of this page too much. However, I felt obligated to somehow include the materials that didn't make the cut, but could still be useful to the reader, which is why I listed them (by topic) below.
